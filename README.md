# SDSS-DR14-classification-of-stars-galaxies-and-quasars
Classification of stars, galaxies and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 14 (DR14)

## Project Overview
The overall aim for this project is to use both a classical, non-neural network approach and a neural network (NN) approach to classify stars, galaxies and quasars from SDSS DR14 and to then compare the two approaches.
We will be employing the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for this problem, as astronomical object classification is a difficult task within astronomy. The use of traditional ML and NN approaches can offer a quick and effective solution to these classification problems.

The project is divided into 3 components:
- **Q1 Traditional ML techniques**
- **Q2 Neural Network approach and comparison with traditional ML**
- **Q3 How different factors affect the performance of a NN**

**Q1**: Here we look at a traditional ML technique, explore how well it performs at this classification task and how we could potentially make it even more accurate. For this traditional approach we will investigate decision trees.
**Q2**: Then we move on to looking at a NN approach. We'll make use of the PyTorch library to build our NN, evaluate how it performs and then compare it to our decision tree.
**Q3**: Finally we'll look at how different factors can impact how our NN peforms, for example how does the amount of training data available to our model affect it's performance?
